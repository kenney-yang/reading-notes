## Growth Mindset
A growth mindset is the inner drive to always want to improve and never settle. ~~Coding is too hard.~~ I can do **anything** I put my mind to. 

- Keep at it no matter how difficult it is!
- Find the time to practice and learn codes **no matter what**!
- Immerse and connect with my like minded individuals!
