## Day 04 Operators and Loops in JAVASCRIPT
### PROGRAMMING


### Expressions and Operators
- Assignment operators (=) is used to assign a value to a variable. 
- Comparison operators: compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. 
  - Equal (==) Returns true if the operands are equal
  - Not equal (!=) Returns true if the operands are not equal
  - Strict equal (===) Returns true if the operands are equal and of the same type.
  - Strict not equal (!==) Returns true if the operands are of the same type but not equal, or are of different type.
  - Greater than (>) Returns true if the left operand is greater than the right operand.
  - Greater than or equal (>=) Returns true if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.
  - Less than (<) Returns true if the left is less than the right operand.
  - Less than or equal (<=) Returns true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.

### Loops
- Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. 
- Repeat an actio some number of times. 
- Various loop mechanisms offer different ways to determine the start and end points of the loop.

### for Loop EXAMPLE
- for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++)
    - for keyword tells JS we are writing a for loop
    - everything in the parenthesis are statements (there's 3 in the example)
    - let is the initializer statement: sets our counter variable to start at a number
    - < conditional statement: tells the loop how many loops to run for
    - i++ increment statement: adds to the counter variable to move it up a loop
    - i++ is the same as i = i + 1


### Completed tasks in class
- Breakout room in Zoom 1st time: (Andrew, Elizabeth, Darius)
  - Taught the robot how to put on a sweater
  - Each person wrote out the instructions
  - Gave your sequence of commands to the robot

### Resources
- replit.com you can write code in there to give you immediate visual to test code
- emojpedia.org
- freecodecamp.org/learn
- free JavaScript courses from codeacademy, 20 hrs worth of lessons there.
