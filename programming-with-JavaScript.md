## Day 04 Programming with JAVASCRIPT
### What is JAVASCRIPT?
- JAVA is not the same thing as JAVASCRIPT. It is like car and carpet, might sound the same but they're completely different.
- The reason why their names are similar was because JAVA came first and it was popular. JAVA has a rough learning curve but really robust. 
- Majority of the websites are written in JAVASCRIPT.
- In the financial industry, they're written in JAVA. 
- You can ask the user for inputs and enteract with the users (behavior).
- DOM means page


### How the language is written?
- camelCase (it starts with a lowercase before another word that starts with Uppercase)
- consolde.log("Proof of life!")
- var we are going to use mostly in 102
- let we are going to use if the variable is going to change values
- const we awre going to use if the value will never change
- changing values is not the same as updating a value
- vanilla JAVASCRIPT uses var
- ; is used at the end of each statement
- it doesn't necessarily care about space
- prompt - call a function or method is built into JAVASCRIPT (ask the user for something)

### What is DOM?
- Document Object Model

### What is Boolean?
- Something that is true or false

### Features
- Variables - like a bucket that hold strings
- Strings - data type
- Numbers - 
- Arrays

### JavaScript building blocks
- Conditional statements
- Loops
- Functions
- Events

### JavaScript objects
- Most things are objects
- Can create your own objects to encapsulate related functions and variables into efficient packages

### Resources
- Code.org has a series of videos to watch to learn about programming
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#Creation_at_Netscape (a quick primer on why things ended up the way they did)
- developer.mozilla.org
