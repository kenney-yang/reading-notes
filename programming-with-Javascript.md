## Day 04 Programming with JAVASCRIPT
### PROGRAMMING
- Computer is only doing exactly what we want it do
- JAVAScript is just another language that speaks to the computer
- Best to write all your instructions in plain English and translate that into JavaScript
- 

### Control flow 
- Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.

### Reminder 
- camelCase (it starts with a lowercase before another word that starts with Uppercase)
- consolde.log("Proof of life!")
- var we are going to use mostly in 102
- let we are going to use if the variable is going to change values
- const we awre going to use if the value will never change
- changing values is not the same as updating a value
- vanilla JAVASCRIPT uses var
- ; is used at the end of each statement
- it doesn't necessarily care about space
- prompt - call a function or method is built into JAVASCRIPT (ask the user for something)

### What is Refactoring?
- Calling a function and use it multiple times


### What is Function?
- It's a verb, asking to do something
- function addTwoNumbers() = add is telling it what to do
- code block is shown in between these {} = literally a block of code
- augment (when invoked) will fulfill the parameter
- You first have to define how to do it and then you give the instructions
- flag indentify what it is you're calling for
- Call your function only after you define it
- Calling it is the same as invokin it

### Features
- Variables - like a bucket that hold strings
- Strings - data type
- Numbers - 
- Arrays

### JavaScript building blocks
- Conditional statements
- Loops
- Functions
- Events

### Completed tasks in class
- Breakout room in Zoom 1st time: (Andrew, Elizabeth, Darius)
  - Taught the robot how to put on a sweater
  - Each person wrote out the instructions
  - Gave your sequence of commands to the robot
- Breakout room in Zoom 2nd time: (

### Resources
- Code.org has a series of videos to watch to learn about programming
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#Creation_at_Netscape (a quick primer on why things ended up the way they did)
- developer.mozilla.org
