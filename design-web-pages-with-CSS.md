## Day 02 Design web pages with CSS

### What is CSS?
- Git is a Version Control System (DVCS) that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots.
- Record changes in what is called a repository (repo), where we can see who made changes "when" and "what"
- Without Version Control System, we would have to store different versions on our systems and constantly emailing back and forth (inefficient!)
- Simply put, it ## 1) Tracks history and 2) Allows developers to work together ##

### Why Git?
- There is two VCS: centralized (single point of failure if server fails) and distributed (every team member has a copy of project on his/her machine)
- Git is a distributed system
- Free
- Open Source
- Super Fast
- Scalable
- Cheap Branching/Merging
- It is used by majority of software developers

### What we learned and completed on Day 02

- Add, Committ, Push
- Add = adding to your project
- Committ = saving your codes
- Push = getting it deployed so it can go live
- Git mostly relies on local operations because most necessary information can be found in local resources.
- Each time you save a changed version of your project, it's called commit

## Cloning

- You can also create a copy of an existing Git repository from a particular server by using the clone command with a repositoryâ€™s URL:
- By clonng the file, you have copied all versions of all files for a project.
