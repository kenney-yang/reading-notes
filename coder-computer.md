# My Learning Journal

## Day 01 Coder's Computer

### What we learned and completed on Day 01

### Choosing the code editor

- With so many code editors out there, different developers have their preferred tool.
- I remember I was so hung up with which code editor to use that I just never got started.
- In the class, we're using Visual Studio Code and this is the one I will try to get good at.
- With so many great choices in code editors, I will eventually venture out to try others when I feel confident with Visual Studio Code.

Most important features in a code editor:

- 1.) code completion;
- 2.) syntax highlighting; 
- 3.) a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue); 
- 4.) the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them. You might find some other
features that are must-haveâ€™s, but I think these features are a good start.

### Command Line

- Using the terminal to navigate feels so foreign for someone like myself who relies on GUI.
- With enough practice, I could see how efficient this tool can be (that's if you can memorize the commands). 

### Navigation

- Print Working Directory. The first command we learn is **pwd** which simply allows us to know where we are.
- List. If we want to know what is in our current location, we'll use **ls** command.
- Change Directories. Move to another directory, we'll use **cd** command. 

### Everything is a File

- Common extensions:
- file.exe - an executable file, or program.
- file.txt - a plain text file.
- file.png, file.gif, file.jpg - an image.
- List the contents of a directory, including hidden files, we'll use **ls -a** command.
