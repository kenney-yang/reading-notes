## Day 02 HTML: Hyper Text Markup Language

# Hypertext allows web pages to links together. 

## Anatomy of an HTML element

- The  **Element** are used to describe the structure of the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).

- Let's use paragraph as an example:  

\<p> at the front is the **Opening Tag** while \</p> is the **Closing Tag**
The text in between the tags is known as the **Content**

\<p>This is when I wish I'm in Hawaii\</p>

When elements are put within other elements, this is referred to as nested elements  
For example. wrapping a word with \<i> would make it appear italic.

## Anatomy of an HTML document
 
HTML is like framing a house, as you're building out your website, you will need to determine the number of frames (like rooms in a house) you try to add on your page and its intended purpose  (i.e. kitchen, restroom, bedrooms, garage, etc.)

- \<!DOCTYPE html> is a required preamble to ensure everything works how it should
- \<html></html> wraps all the content on the page like the outer frame of a house
- \<body></body> contains all the content you want shown to the page's viewers
- \<head></head> Information that is shown within the main pat of the browser
- \<meta charset="utf-8"> sets the character set for the document
- \<title></title> sets the title of your page which shows on the browsers tab

### Marking Up Text

- \<ul> are Unordered Lists 
- \<ol> are Ordered Lists
- \<li> will wrap each item within a list
- \<h1>â€“\<h6> specifies the level of heading (how big the font size)
- \<!-- and --> any text within the arrows is ignored and is an HTML comment
- \<p> contains paragraphs


### Links

To add a link first wrap your text with an \<a> element  
You will then add an href attribute with the web-address inside double quotes after href  
Ex. \<a \href="https/">Disney World</a>

## WireFrame Design

Before building any webpages, you first must think about what the purpose and function of the webpages are for. 
Being able to identify your audience is important and it is through research that you can cater your design to the users.

This is when wireframe comes in. Working in wireframe is like having a blueprint for architecture, it is just outline of what you want to create in your design without any other noises on the page. It is import to focus on meeting the clients needs.
