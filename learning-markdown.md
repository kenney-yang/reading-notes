# My Learning Journal

## Day 01 Learning Markdown

### Markdown is a lightweight markup language for generating html files.

### What we learned and completed on Day 01
- Configured our computers for professional software development, setting up a command line interface (Terminal) and installing VS Code, git, NodeJS, npm, and more.
- Wrote code in a code editor as opposed to general-purpose document creation software.
- Navigated folders and created files from the command line, while verifying their work in the operating system's GUI file explorer.

## Markdown Basic Syntax
- The headings syntax is similar to html where one # is ***h1***, ## is ***h2***, ### is ***h3***, etc.
- Blank line is used to separate one or more lines of text, where ***p*** is used in html.
- End a line with two or more spaces, where ***br*** is used in html for line breaks.
- Markdown is a new language to me so learning its syntax was a bit confusing as html is what I have seen.
