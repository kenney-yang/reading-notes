# My Learning Journal

## Day 01 Learning Markdown

## Markdown is a lightweight markup language for generating html files.

## What we learned and did on Day 01
- Configured our computers for professional software development, setting up a command line interface (Terminal) and installing VS Code, git, NodeJS, npm, and more.
- Wrote code in a code editor as opposed to general-purpose document creation software.
- Navigated folders and created files from the command line, while verifying their work in the operating system's GUI file explorer.
