### What is JAVASCRIPT?
- JAVA is not the same thing as JAVASCRIPT. It is like car and carpet, might sound the same but they're completely different.
- The reason why their names are similar was because JAVA came first and it was popular. JAVA has a rough learning curve but really robust. 
- Majority of the websites are written in JAVASCRIPT.
- In the financial industry, they're written in JAVA. 
- You can ask the user for inputs and enteract with the users (behavior).

- Arrays

### JavaScript building blocks
- Conditional statements

### JavaScript objects
