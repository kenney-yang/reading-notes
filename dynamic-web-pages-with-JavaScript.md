## Day 03 Design web pages with JAVASCRIPT

### What is JAVASCRIPT?
- (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS is, with a simple syntax example, and also covers some key terms about the language.
- If HTML is the kitchen then CSS would be like the interior design feature of a restaurant. For example, the color of the walls, the decors, the layout of the furniture, etc. 
- <div> is great to have a box to house everything together

### Apply Color for CSS?
- Color is a good way to start learning about CSS
- You can either type in the color you want to use or get the specific code that is specific to a specific color
- Color.adobe.com gives you a wide selection of colors in real time with associated color codes called Hex.

### Id and class when using <div> 
- With multiple <div>, you would need class to differentiate which div youâ€™re referring to. 
- You can name whatever you want in class, it only needs to makes sense to you.
- Id is another way in Class to target a div (single element)
- Inside of the inspect tool in Chrome, the upper left icon can directly target what you're looking for in the codes. 
- Example: body {color: rgb(201, 76, 76)

### Property Values
- **Color** specifies the text color. There are **A LOT** of color values to choose from
- **Initial** sets this property to its value
- **Inherit** inherits this propery from its parent element

### Cascading Order
**ORDER DOES MATTER**
- 1) Inline style (inside an HTML element)
- 2) External and internal style sheets (in the head section)
- 3) Browser default
